    <div class="body">
      <p>hub-db contains data of images from the adult pornography website <a href="http://pornhub.com">PornHub</a>. Within <a href="https://github.com/cdipaolo/hub-db">the repository</a> is the code used to scrape the data, as well as a data folder which contains all the raw and processed data. Along with image links (no images have been downloaded, only links to the images) we crawl image and album metadata, such as tags, comments, views, votes, upvote percentages, etc. which should make the dataset widely applicable.</p>
      
      <h3>Downloading The Data</h3>
      <p>Option 1 - download specific data files and/or ignore the code to generate the data</p>
      <pre id="downloading">1. Go to http://kinolien.github.io/gitzip/
2. input https://github.com/cdipaolo/hub-db/tree/master/data into the search bar and click 'search'
3. download any files you'd like</pre>
      
      <p>Option 2 - clone the repository</p>
      <pre id="downloading"># using https
$ git clone https://github.com/cdipaolo/hub-db.git

# using ssh
$ git clone git@github.com:cdipaolo/hub-db.git</pre>


      <!-- Data Schemas -->
      <h3>Data Schema</h3>
      <p>In each of the processed data files, every line is a JSON object. Here we show the structure of each file's JSON objects in Go syntax (to show types) as well as an example object. Note that the Go syntax structure docs weren't used (necessarily) to crawl the data, but you could use them to pull data from the dataset.</p>
      
      <!-- albums -->
      <h4 id="albums">albums.json</h4>
      <p>The preprocessed albums dataset contains broad information about albums without going including all information about the associated images (besides the associated image-id's). Note that <b>tags within albums are the same across all images within that album</b>.</p>

As a unit, this file describes an undirected, weighted graph.</p>
      <p>Note that each edge array includes the node tag (self referencing node). This tells you the total frequency of the tag throughout the dataset. It also means that every node included has an edge array.</p>
