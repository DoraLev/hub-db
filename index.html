          <p>hub-db contains data of images from the adult pornography website <a href="http://pornhub.com">PornHub</a>. Within <a href="https://github.com/cdipaolo/hub-db">the repository</a> is the code used to scrape the data, as well as a data folder which contains all the raw and processed data. Along with image links (no images have been downloaded, only links to the images) we crawl image and album metadata, such as tags, comments, views, votes, upvote percentages, etc. which should make the dataset widely applicable.</p>


        <h4>Basic Structure and Formatting</h4>
        <p>The raw data follows the structure outlined in the README of the repository and is generated page by page along the most-viewed images search on PornHub. The processed data has been produced from MRJob (MapReduce) jobs ran along that raw data. Processed data includes album level data, image level data, and comments level data. All of this data is in files where each line is a JSON object. Further basic processing on the album tags gives a csv file showing each tag and it's frequency, as well as a csv file showing the number of observed occurrences of each other tag with any given tag (ie. nodes and edges in the graph of tag occurrences)</p>
